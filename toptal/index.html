    <p>I do not really have a blog. My working and university hours do not let me, once I am busy the whole week and several weekends, I would say. Nor would I like to make any excuses about not having I blog with content, but when I start writing posts I would like it to be relevant. This job post, though, might help me start it up.</p>

<p>I have been a web developer for six years now. Right after finishing the technician program I took along with the high school, I could start at a company which helped me out with putting in practice my programming studies. That was the very first time I had any real world contact with developing websites. Most of all, for small companies that were needing a presence on the web. After quitting that job, in order to achieve new projects, I started at AgÃªncia Escape. It was great because I could build projects for bigger companies and have directly contact with clients and a bigger team.</p>

<p>By the middle of 2013, I had an awesome opportunity to move to Toronto and study at the University of Toronto as part of my studies. The federal government of Brazil was sending the best students abroad to have an international experience and bring knowledge to the country. I was very thankful to be chosen as one of the students and live in that amazing city.</p>

<p>For now, I work with freelances, and people I know. And it has been great. I want, however, to get out of my comfort zone. This is what motivates me. What makes me work harder. It was what made me move to Toronto, or try new projects. And a remote job, with remote people, at a remote, bigger, company would take me out of it. Therefore, I am ready to accept new challenges and get a remote job.</p>

<p>And Toptal seems to offer me exactly that: an opportunity to improve myself as a better developer, possibility to make something unusual from what people are doing around me, build amazing software.</p>

<p>That is why I want to work at Toptal.</p>
